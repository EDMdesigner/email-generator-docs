# Image element

Images are one of the most important design elements of a commercial email, but they should be used with caution. [More on that](https://blog.edmdesigner.com/12-extremely-easy-tips-for-effective-use-of-images-in-email-design/)

Images are relatively complex elements. Just like boxes, they can have paddings, margins, borders, background color (no background image property, because it would not have a good fallback resolution to set the same image as background, because of the poor client support of the background image), and they canâ€™t have children.

```
{
	"type" : "IMAGE",
	"align" : "center",
	"background" : {
		"color" :"#60de55"
	},
	"border" : {
		...
		},
	},
	"margin" : {
		...
	},
	"padding" : {
		...
	},
	"height" : 300,
	"width" : 310,
	"sizeType" : "FIXED",
	"originalHeight" : 300,
	"originalWidth" : 300,
	"altText" : "cactii",
	"customData" : {},
	"src" : "https://example.com",
	"link" : "https://example.com",
	"mini" : false
}
```
