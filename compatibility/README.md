#Email compatibility of our generated code

Unlike the web, which has just a few browsers handling most traffic, emails are read in a huge variety of email applications, or clients. 

The varying levels of support across email clients and their rendering engines leads to a lot of display issues, which is why the emails need to constantly be tested before pushing send. The code generated by our email HTML generator, that is used by the EDMdesigner and Chamaileon editor, is tested frequently on the major email clients and email preview services as Email On Acid and Litmus.
